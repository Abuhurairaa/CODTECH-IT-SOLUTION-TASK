# Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity Research

This repository contains information about my hands-on experiences in ethical hacking and cybersecurity research. I've performed various tasks using different tools to enhance my skills and knowledge in the field.

## Task 3: Information Gathering with Maltego

I used Maltego, a GUI-based tool, to gather information about a target site. Maltego helped in visualizing and analyzing the relationships between different data points, aiding in reconnaissance.

## Task 4: Sniffing Attack with Wireshark

Wireshark, a powerful packet analyzer tool, was employed to study network traffic. I explored how to find credentials (ID and password) for an HTTP website by analyzing captured packets.

## Task 5: Network Scanning with Nmap

Nmap, a network scanning tool, was used to identify open ports and vulnerable services on a network. The results provided insights into potential security risks and entry points.

## Task 7: Password Cracking with John the Ripper

In collaboration with CODTECH IT SOLUTION, I attempted to crack a simple password, "123456" using John the Ripper. This task aimed to demonstrate the importance of strong password policies.
